Erldocs
=======

this is the code used to generate documentation for erlang projects in the format of [erldocs.com](http://erldocs.com)

To build the documentation for your own project, add the paths to your erlang files to priv/sys.conf (its recommended to download and add the erlang otp files as well, they are not included in this source) and run the command 

`./erldocs`
